# Problem statement

Use OpenCV Object tracking to make Traffic Management System. 

Use appropriate Road footage. ( I used stock video from www.pexels.com)

Track only Heavy vehicles (like car, bus, truck, etc.) from Traffic with all types of vehicles (including bikes, bicycle, people, etc.). 

Return the tracked co-ordinates for each object separately.



#

Some other useful applications of Code can be in Keeping tracks of objects on conveyor belt, Cheacking Object Trajectory, Counting people in certain area, other traffic scenarios, etc.
